E-Commerce Goods Shipment Duration prediction and Estimating Late Delivery Risk
E-commerce goods Late delivery risk identification by predicting fastest and normal Shipping Durations. The Decision Tree model built by us, will enable E-commerce and Goods/products delivery industries to identify the 'risk of late delivery' and predict the fastest and normal duration of goods shipment for their Inland and foreign clients/ customers/buyers.


GOAL
i) Building a Multi-Output Decision Tree Regressor to determine the maximum range of shipping time, by predicting the Fastest and Normal duration for shipping of goods for both Inland and International customers.
ii) Building a Binary Classifier to classify orders with high probabilty of late delivery (Late Delivery Risk analyser).
